A collection of rake tasks to annotate files with ActiveRecord model information.
Currently, this plugin annotates the following files:

  - app/models/*.rb
  - test/factories/*_factory.rb


Example
=======

The plugin comes with these tasks:

  - annotate:all        Annotates factories (that is, factory_girl ones) and models.
  - annotate:factories  Annotates only model files.
  - annotate:models     Annotates only factory files.
  - annotate:print      Only prints out annotations.

To invoke it, simply type:

  > rake annotate:all


Compatibility
=============

Tested with Rails 3.0.3 & Ruby 1.9.2 on Mac OS X.


This plugin is my own implementation and shares no code with other pre-existing
implementations save the name.
